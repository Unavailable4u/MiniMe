"""
eo/code_loader.py — Stage 4 step 5's missing piece for tier 2.

Part 2.5: "Tier 2 calls directly into the existing 19-agent roster's
specialists" — but every one of those specialists (reviewer.py,
fixer_pool.py, code_writers.py's refactor path, etc.) reads its input from
memory.bus's submitted_code key, which normally only gets populated by a
tier-3 cycle's own Code Writer Pool. A tier-2 "directed task against an
EXISTING codebase" (Part 2.1's own tier-2 definition) has no such cycle —
the code already exists on disk under apps/{app_slug}/. This module is
the bridge: read what's actually on disk, write it into memory in the
exact shape the tier-3 agents already expect, so they can't tell the
difference between "code a Code Writer just produced this cycle" and
"code that's been sitting in the repo since a prior cycle."

Deliberately NOT part of the tier-3 pipeline and NOT invoked by loop.py —
this only exists for eo/loop_v4.py's tier-2 path.
