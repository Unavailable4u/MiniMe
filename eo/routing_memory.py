"""
eo/routing_memory.py — Stage 4 step 7 of the roadmap:
    "Wire eo:routing_outcome and the Cross-Cycle Memory Search feedback
    loop (Part 8.3)."

Two jobs, deliberately mirroring agents/memory_search.py's own
store/retrieve split (same Upstash Vector index, a different id prefix so
the two never collide or get queried against each other):

  log_outcome(task_text, decision, outcome) — call once execution for a
      task has actually finished (or failed). Writes the raw record to
      Redis DB5 under "eo:routing_outcome" (Part 7's schema) AND embeds
      it into Vector, so future Inspector calls can retrieve similar past
      decisions.
  retrieve_similar_outcomes(task_text, top_k=3) — returns a short text
      block of similar past (task, tier, outcome) triples. This is
      OPTIONAL context an Inspector caller can pass into
      eo.inspector.classify()'s `context` parameter — it augments what
      the Inspector sees, it never tells the Inspector what to conclude,
      preserving the "classifies HONESTLY" contract inspector.py's own
      docstring insists on.

`outcome` is intentionally a free-form string, not a fixed enum — Part
8.3 describes this as "a manual or lightly-scripted process," and the
actual judgment of whether a routing decision was later found to be
under/over-routed is exactly the human-in-the-loop step Part 8.3 wants,
not something this module should guess at automatically.
