"""
eo/registry.py — Stage 4, step 1 of the v5 Master Blueprint's build roadmap
(Part 10).
Single source of truth mapping an agent *name* (string, the vocabulary the
Inspector/Router speak in) to the real, importable Python callable that
does the work, plus a couple of bits of metadata router.py and the future
executor need.
This module intentionally does NOT execute anything. It only resolves
names -> callables. That keeps it safe to import from tests, from
router.py, and eventually from an executor, without any side effects
(no LLM calls, no memory writes) just from `import eo.registry`.
The production 19-agent roster (tier 3, Part 4 of the blueprint), plus
Tier 0's Responder and Tier 1's lean pipeline (Part 2.3-2.4, added in
Stage 4 steps 2-4 of the roadmap), are all wired up here.
