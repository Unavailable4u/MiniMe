eo/router.py — Stage 4, step 1 of the v5 Master Blueprint's build roadmap
(Part 10, Stage 4.1):
    "Build registry.py + router.py against tier 3 only — confirm the
    Router can reproduce today's exact 19-agent sequence with zero
    behavior change, before touching routing logic."
This module only ANSWERS THE QUESTION "for this tier (and, at tier 2,
this directed_task_type), which agent names run, in what order?" It does
not call anything itself — see eo/registry.py for name->callable
resolution, and a later-stage executor for actually running the graph.
Nothing in loop.py is touched by this file. It is purely additive and
inert until something imports and calls it.

# Tier 3 — full roster, Part 4 of the blueprint.
#
# This list is deliberately hand-copied from loop.py's actual call order
# (not "what Part 4's table implies"), because the point of this step is
# fidelity to what the system does today, not to what the table says it
# should do.
#
#   Note (corrected): agents/review_aggregator.py's aggregate_reviews()
#   IS called -- from inside agents/reviewer.py's run_reviewer(), right
#   after the 3-worker Reviewer Pool finishes, before review_notes is
#   written. It never needs its own line in this roster because it isn't
#   a standalone pipeline step -- it's an internal merge step inside the
#   "reviewer" agent itself, same as security_aggregator.py is a
#   standalone roster entry for Scanner Pool but review_aggregator.py is
#   not for Reviewer Pool. (An earlier version of this comment claimed
#   loop.py never called it -- that was true of an older reviewer.py,
#   not the current one. Confirmed by reading reviewer.py directly.)
