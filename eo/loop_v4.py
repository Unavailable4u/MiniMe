eo/loop_v4.py — Stage 4.2 of the roadmap (Part 10):

    "Add the Inspector, wired to always classify but forced to tier 3
    regardless of its own output — validates classification quality
    against real volume without affecting execution yet."

This is deliberately a THROWAWAY-SHAPED script for one purpose: run the
Inspector on every real task you throw at the system, log what it would
have decided, but always execute exactly what loop.py already does today.
Once Stage 4.3's fixture results (tests/test_eo_inspector.py) and enough
real `eo:task_classification` entries give you confidence, later stages
progressively let lower tiers actually take effect (Stage 4.4 onward) —
none of that logic lives here yet, on purpose.

loop.py itself is NOT imported-and-modified, only imported-and-called —
same file, same behavior, unconditionally, every time. That's the whole
point of this stage: prove the new layer observes without changing
anything, before it's trusted to change anything.

Usage (mirrors loop.py's own):
    python eo/loop_v4.py "a one-sentence idea for the app"
    python eo/loop_v4.py            (resumes an existing run, same as loop.py)

Manual override (Part 3) is a no-op right now — tier is ALWAYS forced to
3 at this stage regardless of --tier, since nothing below tier 3 exists
yet to route to. The flag is accepted (not rejected) so scripts/CI calling
it with --tier 3 today don't break when tier 0-2 execution lands later.
