"""
api/task_runner.py — Stage 6, step 2 (Part 10).

A programmatic sibling to eo/loop_v4.py's CLI dispatch. Reuses the same
underlying decision logic (imported straight from loop_v4, not
reimplemented) but returns structured dicts instead of printing to
stdout, so the FastAPI layer (api/server.py) can turn a task into a JSON
response instead of terminal output.

Scope for this step: tiers 0, 1, 2 only. Each of those already resolves
in a single call — no background process, no interactivity. Tier 3 is
NOT run here: loop_v4.py's tier-3 path blocks on input() for the
cost-ceiling confirmation (Part 8.1) and hands off to loop.py, which is
a long-running process, not something a single HTTP request/response
cycle can represent. Wiring tier 3 through the API belongs later in
Stage 6, once the relay (step 1) and background execution exist to
support it — see run_task()'s tier-3 branch below for the placeholder
response.

Deliberately does NOT modify loop_v4.py. It imports loop_v4's
underscore-prefixed helpers directly (_get_decision, in particular)
rather than duplicating the Inspector/panel/override logic — that logic
is the one piece that must never drift between the CLI and the API.

    Runs one task through the EO layer and returns a single structured
    result dict — no printing, no blocking on stdin.

    session_id: pass the frontend's own generated ID here so it can
        subscribe to the Pusher channel *before* the request is sent
        (see relay/emitter.py's channel-per-session-id design). Since
        this endpoint runs the whole graph synchronously and only
        returns once it's done, a session_id minted after the fact
        would be useless -- every event would already have fired with
        nobody subscribed yet. Falls back to generating one here only
        for callers that don't care about live events (CLI, tests).

    Returns a dict always shaped as:
        {
            "decision": {...},      # the Inspector/panel routing decision
